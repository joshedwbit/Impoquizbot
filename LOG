So far;

Started about 01/03/2021, early questions required use of more basic pyautogui functions such as pag.moveTo, pag.click only requiring input of coordinates.

Coordinate mapping was something I learnt along the way, mostly by making use of the for _ in range(1000), print pag.position() function.

A range of techniques were used overall i.e. recording questions on my phone to find where my current clicks were, and how I could tweak them to make them more accurate,
the correct timing between questions i.e. hovering (allowing for LAG), also used a stopwatch on YT walkthrough tutorials for this.  I also used printscreens to see where
I should be clicking relative to other objects on screen.

stuck on question 102, moving the mouse to multiple red circles of different sizes on the screen, takes the script 5mins to get to this point (optimal), hard to record the
location of each circle, tried videoing it and measuring relative to other objects.  Gaining a better understanding of the lenght of i.e. 10 bits.
trying out the pag.locateonscreen function but its not very good for resized images!

Finaly finished q102, had to brute force it i.e. use the video on my phone to find a rough location, then run the script, record the result and tweak accordingly (inefficient
but i'm not sure theres any better method if locateonscreen doesn't work.
A USEFUL TRICK; if I couldn't pinpoint the precise location, I'd take note of the x coordinate, and simply trace a pag.moveTo along a vertical line so that the red dot was
intercepted on the path.

Code incomplete, question 106 is too laggy making it very hard to complete, could also be glitched.  Will complete when I have lots of free time in the future.  
A single simulation takes 6 minutes=very costly for time
