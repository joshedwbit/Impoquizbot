# Impoquizbot

A bot for the popular game 'the impossible quiz'.  The game itself presents a range of questions of different styles and formats, which required full use of the Pyautogui library, as well as others along the way.

The impossible quiz was a great game released in 2007, and was seemingly impossible to complete.  Even by todays gaming standards the quiz is incredibly hard.  The furthest question I reached in childhood was around the mid 70s, which provoked the design of this bot to complete the quiz simply and efficiently.
